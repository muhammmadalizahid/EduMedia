Hello Claude,

We are going to implement the **frontend** for the EduMedia project. Your task is to create a fully functional, minimalistic, modern frontend using **HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript**. The frontend should be fully responsive and work well on all common desktop and mobile browsers.

---

### Requirements

**Project Title:** EduMedia  
**Purpose:** Academic DSA project simulating a social media system.

**Key Requirements for Frontend:**
1. The frontend must have pages and UI elements to support **all five modules**:
   - User Management
   - Post Management
   - Feed Management / Core DS Logic
   - Browsing History
   - Search & Sorting

2. The UI should allow users to:
   - Create, view, and edit their profile
   - View a feed of posts (FIFO)
   - Add, edit, delete, like/unlike posts
   - Comment on posts
   - Navigate feed and perform undo operations (stack-based)
   - Search posts and friends
   - Sort feed and friend list

3. The design should be:
   - Minimalistic but modern
   - Clean layout with readable fonts and spacing
   - Simple navigation (menu bar or sidebar)
   - Fully responsive (desktop + tablet + mobile)
   - Functional without any backend yet (use **mock JS data structures** to simulate feed, posts, and users for frontend testing)

---

### Technical Instructions

1. **HTML:**
   - Create a main `index.html` file
   - Include semantic elements (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `footer`)
   - Include placeholders for:
     - User profile
     - Post feed
     - Post creation/editing
     - Comments
     - Friends list
     - Search bar
     - Sorting buttons

2. **CSS:**
   - Use `style.css` for all styles
   - Make it visually clean with neutral colors
   - Ensure responsive layout (media queries for small, medium, and large screens)
   - Style buttons, forms, and feed items clearly
   - Highlight active elements (e.g., selected post or friend)
   - Maintain consistent spacing, margins, and fonts

3. **JavaScript (`app.js`):**
   - Use JS **only for frontend behavior**, including:
     - Displaying posts (simulate a queue with JS array)
     - Adding/editing/deleting posts
     - Liking/unliking posts
     - Commenting on posts
     - Search functionality (filter posts or friends by keyword)
     - Sorting feed and friends (simple JS sort on arrays)
     - Navigation tracking for “Back” / Undo actions (simulate stack behavior)
   - You may use mock data objects to represent users, posts, friends, and comments
   - Ensure all frontend logic works **without the backend**, so we can later integrate Supabase easily

4. **General Guidelines:**
   - Keep code modular: separate functions for post management, feed management, history, search/sort
   - Use event listeners properly for buttons and forms
   - Keep naming consistent for IDs and classes
   - Include comments explaining which parts simulate data structures (Queue, Stack, Linked List)
   - Ensure the frontend does **not break** if there are no posts or friends

---

### Deliverables (Frontend)

- `frontend/index.html`
- `frontend/style.css`
- `frontend/app.js`  
- Fully functional simulation of posts, feed, friends, search, sort, and undo  
- Cross-browser compatible (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)  
- Modern, minimalistic, responsive UI  

---

**Important Notes for You (Claude):**
- Focus on **frontend-only behavior** in this prompt; backend integration will come later.
- Use **mock JavaScript data** to simulate DSA logic (Queue for feed, Stack for history, Linked List for friends)
- Make it **ready for integration** with Supabase later
- Keep it simple but visually clean and usable

---

Once done, the frontend should fully simulate all modules in a way that a user can test DSA operations directly in the browser.
